This repo contains a wordgame project that I made for the project work for java-programming course.
Project has a graphical interface that you can play Wordle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) with. 
The input is made from keyboard and by pressing Enter you can submit your guess for each row. 
NOTE: Atm the game functions by choosing words to guess from words.txt in order. By updating this functionality the game becomes more interesting to play.

Project is made with maven (https://maven.apache.org/) that needs to be installed in order to run the project.
When maven is installed project can be run if opened in vscode (propably in other IDEs aswell) and running the Wordle.java -file
OR
from the command line by command "mvn clean javafx:run"
